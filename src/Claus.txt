Claus the snake was not like other snakes.

He slithered through the forest near Berlin, wearing a tiny green hat and muttering,
"Guten Morgen, Baume!" to the trees each day.

Claus had learned German from a hiker's dropped language book and took great pride in his pronunciation.
He greeted rabbits with a polite "Wie geht's?" and startled crows by hissing out "Ich liebe Opernmusik!"

One day, he found a lost child crying near a stream. Claus gently curled beside them and whispered,
"Keine Angst, kleiner Freund. Ich helfe dir."

The child stopped crying, stared, and then laughed.
They followed Claus back to the trail, hand on his scaled back, as he sang
"Alle meine Entchen" in a proud serpentine voice.

From that day forward, Claus became a legend --
not for his fangs,
but for his flawless German and kind heart.
