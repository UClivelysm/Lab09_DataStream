In the heart of the ancient woods, villagers whispered of a shadow in the trees. 
They called it "That Thing" — a beast so ferocious, so terrible, none dared speak of it after dark.

Legends told of glowing eyes, of earth-shaking growls, and the crunch of bones beneath monstrous feet.

One day, a brave adventurer named Corin set out to find the creature. Sword in hand and courage in his chest, 
he ventured deep into the forest, following claw marks and broken branches.

As the sun dipped below the canopy, he found it.

There, coiled peacefully in a patch of wildflowers, was a massive snake — at least twenty feet long, 
its emerald scales shimmering in the fading light. It raised its head slowly... and stared blankly at Corin.

No growl. No hiss. Just a slow blink and the soft flick of its tongue.

Beside the snake sat an old wooden sign, half buried in moss. It read:

"Her name is Frank. She's harmless."

Corin stood there, sword half-raised, feeling slightly ridiculous. After a long pause, Frank blinked again.

He sheathed his weapon, chuckled to himself, and turned back toward the village.

And so, Corin returned not with a monster's head, but with a story — one of myths, misunderstandings, 
and a very large, very uninterested snake named Frank.
